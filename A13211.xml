            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I draw this to a period; but the period of this I muſt ſpeake to you in teares &amp; comfort: in the teares of ſorrow, &amp; in the words of comfort.</p>
            <p>But firſt, in teares: For though God doth ſend a plague amongſt his people;<note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> yet he doth not ſend a plague amongſt his people with de-delight: becauſe amongſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, therefore you that live, muſt take heed how you cenſure them that dye: for the plague, to dye of the plague, is no evidence of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. No, it is the mad zeale of ſome fooliſh people to ſay ſo: were it ſo, King <hi>David</hi> would never have deſired God to ſet his hand, his hand of plague againſt him, if hee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3630:26"/>muſt have gone to hell for it: but yet it is an evidence of wrath, and therefore you muſt take heed of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie; God takes no pleaſure in our ſmarting: No, hee would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly lay aſide his blowes, if words would ſerve. <hi>If:</hi> if he does ſend a plague, it comes hardly from him. He would faine lay aſide this ſharpe plough, but hee cannot otherwiſe breake up the fallow ground of our hearts. Faine would hee lay aſide theſe hammers, but hee cannot by the inſtrument of words, beate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding into our braines. Such ſtout and ſtubborne Schollers are we growne, that no School-maſter will fit us, but this ſevere and ſwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one. God deales with us by theſe foule, becauſe we will not be overcome by faire meanes. Oh God, thou doeſt not willingly plague us, but the ſtrength of our corruptions neceſſarily enforce
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3630:26"/>thee thereunto; which will not otherwiſe bee ſubdued. So Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians and Chyrurgeons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to cut, and launce, and burne, when milder remedies will not prevaile. When God did firſt lift up his hand againſt us in this plague, me thoughts, hee pulled it backe againe, as if he were loath to doe it; yet, ſayes he, <hi>I wil give them a teſtimonie, that they are my people, it may bee, they will repent and cry.</hi> Thats the firſt. It deſires your <hi>Teares</hi> to be waile the hardneſſe of your hearts, though you are his people; becauſe, <hi>If he ſends a plague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſecondly, though you cry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the plague is amongſt you for the hardneſſe of your hearts; yet, deſpaire not: for the very plague ſent by God, teſtifies that you are his people. Never deſpaire, till God leave you to your ſelfe; when he does not love you ſo much as to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3630:27"/>afflict you. When God gives you not ſo much peace as to trouble you, then you may deſpaire. But if you have trouble and ſickneſſe, though that ſickneſſe be the plague, and ſent, deſpaire not; for you are yet his people. So long as God puniſhes you, hee gives you phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke: If he draw his knife, it is but to prune you; you are his vine. If he draw bloud, it is but to rectifie a diſtempered veine; you are his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. If he breake your bones, it is but to ſet them ſtaighter. If hee bruiſe you in mortar, it is but that you may breathe up a ſweet ſavour into his noſtrills; you are his handy worke: and if one hand be under you, let him lay the other as heavy as hee pleaſes upon you: let him handle you which way hee will, if hee does not throw you out of his hands, it is no matter. If GOD frownes upon you, his threatnings
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3630:27"/>are hopefull: But if God looke not upon you at all; then, oh then; you are gone. If he purſue you, you are well; but if hee have left you to you to your ſelves: then, oh then, farewell: but ſo long as God ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies your recoverie, you are well. <hi>Vox eſt animi non habentis in promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu quid ſtatuat, &amp; deſperantis ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> When God hath tried all meanes to reduce you, and failed in all, and then leaves you to your owne deſperate wayes; then, oh then, thou art gone. It is the worſt that ever God did ſay,<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.42.</note>

            <p>See then, if God looke upon you any way, though with frownes in his brow, rod in his hand, menaces in his mouth, plague-ſores upon your bodies; ſubmit unto him, and repent, and turne from your evill wayes, and God ſhall not onely turne from the evill which hee hath brought upon you, but your trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſoule alſo ſhall no ſooner cry out, <hi>Why am I thus viſited with the plague<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> but your faith ſhall make a ſweet reply from this Text, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath God ſent a peſtilence to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us wee are his people, if wee will humble our ſelves.</hi>

And yet for all this, in times of mourning, it wants not proofe, that the Back ſhould teſtifie the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of the Heart ſo well as the tongue.

            <p>But both our deſire and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt bee in the Name of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> no promiſe but in him; no purchaſe but by him: <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall aske in my name, God will give it you: In nomine ejus</hi> it muſt

            </p>
            <p>And being made known by him, our prayers are ſure of acceptance; for he hath purchaſed Gods favour for us, and that by a bloody rate,<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> 
               <hi>By his owne blood; By that hee entred into the holy place, to make interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us,</hi> this makes our Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall ſacrifices acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>To God, I ſay: For as our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt bee offered, <hi>By;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Not to Patriarch, or Prophet; for no precept for that. Not to Angel or Archangell; for no promiſe to that. Not to the Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> or any ſhee Saint; for no example of this, let <hi>Rome</hi> ſay what <hi>Rome</hi> can to the contrary. But this is a matter of diſpute, and ſo diſputed it hath been, that it needs no diſpute here; for they are not able to reply. And beſides, their owne Doctrine and Example choakes them: for their doctrine never taught to offer, their example never did offer any thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to any Saint, or Angel what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And yet thankeſgiving is a part, and a chiefe part, of prayer: and therefore where no thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving is due, there no prayer is due. Nor the one nor the other hath any object, but God: I ſhall therefore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3630:43"/>conclude this with a prayer to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God grant wee may never betake our ſelves to any other ſhelter, than</hi> Vmbra altiſſimi, <hi>that of God; for bleſſed be the people that bee in ſuch a caſe; yea, bleſſed are the people which have the Lord for their God.

            <p>Many objections are made againſt the neceſſitie of prayer, and againſt the efficacie of prayer.

               </note> and the third ingredient for the cure of the plague, <hi>Repentance</hi> is; It is a purging pill, it purges us of ſin, and God of wrath. <hi>If my people turne from their wicked wayes, I will forgive their ſinne.</hi> And herein I ſhall deſire you to obſerve with me, 1. <hi>Qui,</hi> who are to turne, <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, &amp; populus univerſus, my people, and all my people.</hi> 2. <hi>Quid eſt,</hi> what it is to turne.

            </p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt,<note place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">a,</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ae,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ae.</hi> Who to turne.</note> 
               <hi>Qui,</hi> Who ſhould turne; <hi>populus, &amp; populus univerſus, My people, and all my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> 1. <hi>Gods people:</hi> for they that are not Gods people, either cannot, or doe not: They cannot, for want of grace; they doe not, for want of skill: They have no correction to drive them to it, they have no dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to guide them in it: ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py they, they that are not Gods
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3630:45"/>people, that they have no unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; <hi>They come in no misfortune, like other folk.</hi> So happy we, we, that are Gods people, that wee have many unhappineſſes. We come into miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune above all other folke; onely our miſ-hap becomes a good hap; and our miſ-fortune, a Fortune, a good fortune.</p>
            <p>For when God whippes us, wee reade it in <hi>Corrigit,</hi> a <hi>Chaſtiſement;</hi> but when God whippes them, it is in <hi>punit,</hi> a <hi>puniſhment.</hi> Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are alwayes for amendment, puniſhments co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly for amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When God does <hi>Caſtigare,</hi> correct his people, it is to amend them: When God does <hi>punire,</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them that are not his people, it is to end them. With his people, God deales as a Father with his Childe, as a Maſter with his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And why doeth the Father

            </p>
            <p>Such a happineſſe there is in being Gods people, for all the plague; and as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayd, <hi>He thanked God, hee was a</hi> Man, <hi>and not a</hi> Beaſt; <hi>a</hi> Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>and not a</hi> Barbarian: So we muſt, at leaſt, ſo wee ſhould, bleſſe the Name of <hi>God,</hi> that we are <hi>men,</hi> and not <hi>beaſts, Chriſtians,</hi> and not <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels; his people,</hi> and not them, nor of them that are not <hi>his people:</hi> and God make us all ſo happy, that all of us may alwayes, eſpecially in this time of plague, as <hi>to turne from our wicked wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is not onely firſt, <hi>Populus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> all the people.</note> but ſecondly, <hi>Populus univerſus;</hi> not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3630:47"/>onely <hi>My people,</hi> but <hi>All my people muſt turne:</hi> For all the people are ſinners; and therefore all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are in danger of the plague; and in more danger, becauſe this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is more dangerous than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſickenſſes, it is infectious; it is amongſt us that tarry heere in the City; it may overtake them that are gone into the Countrey. I pray God it may not overtake them; I pray God remove it from amongſt us: But yet it is amongſt us, and for ought they know, or any man elſe, it may goe after them. If in King <hi>Davids</hi> dayes, it went from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba;</hi> it may in our dayes goe from <hi>London,</hi> to the fartheſt parts of <hi>England:</hi> No way to remove it from us, no way to keepe it from them; but for them, and us, and all the people of God, <hi>To turne from our wicked wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were the ſinne but private, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3630:47"/>particular, and the puniſhment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, why then happily that particular mans <hi>turning</hi> might turne the plague out of doores. But the ſinne, alas, is univerſall, and the puniſhment Epidemicall: All of us are ſinners, all of us, though not happily all of us in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, yet all of us in ſome degree are ſinners, and moſt of us all in a very high degree, <hi>God have mercy upon us;</hi> and all of us are puniſhed, ſome by feeling, ſome by fearing; ſome of us ſmart actually, all of us potentially; and therefore all of us muſt <hi>turne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, now I thinke on't, though the ſinne were but private, and that private man had the paſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in reſpect of his owne ſin, and cryed out with the Publican, <hi>God be mercifull unto me a ſinner;</hi> yet notwithſtanding all men ſhould bee compaſſionate towards the ill caſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3630:48"/>of others, and communicate with him in a joynt Repentance; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe hee is a member of the ſame Body. But the ſinne, as I ſayd before, is generall; we all ſay, and many of us, <hi>God mend our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> doe but ſay ſo, <hi>We have erred and ſtrayed from thy wayes like loſt ſheepe;</hi> and therefore all of us muſt participate in Repentance, and ſay, <hi>There is no health in us; but thou oh Lord have mercy upon us miſerable offenders:</hi> For the Church is <hi>Corpus Homogeneum,</hi> and therefore <hi>Eadem eſt ratio partis &amp; totius.</hi> All men are one Body, and every man is a member of that one body; and therefore the ſame remedy ſerveth both; what every man muſt doe in particular, all men muſt doe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>All men are but one Body, and thus the Members are placed: The <hi>King</hi> is the Head, the <hi>Divine</hi> is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3630:48"/>the Heart, the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the <hi>Lawyer</hi> is the Tongue, the <hi>Souldier</hi> is the Armes, the <hi>Merchant</hi> is the Lungs, the <hi>Commons</hi> are the Feete. The <hi>King</hi> rules, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> prayes, the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> feeds, the <hi>Lawyer</hi> pleads, the <hi>Souldier</hi> fights, the <hi>Merchant</hi> breaths, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> travaile: None of theſe can be ſpared, for then the Body will be imperfect; and therefore all of theſe, all Gods people muſt <hi>Turne.</hi> The <hi>King,</hi> though a <hi>King,</hi> and therefore the beſt of men; yet he is but a man, and therefore a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and a Carbuncle may come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Head; but I pray God, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Head, King <hi>Charles,</hi> from plague and peſtilence: The <hi>Prieſt,</hi> though a Biſhop, and the holieſt of then, yet hee is but a man, and therefore a ſinner; and the poyſon of the plague may poſſeſſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Heart; but I pray God

            <p>No way to perſwade <hi>God</hi> to this, but for the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>Heart;</hi> and the <hi>Liver,</hi> and the <hi>Tongue;</hi> and the <hi>Armes,</hi> and the <hi>Lungs;</hi> and the <hi>Feet,</hi> and all; <hi>all Gods people to turne from their wicked wayes.</hi> Some there be, that think themſelves too good to humble themſelves, and <hi>turne;</hi> and ſome that thinke themſelves too unworthy to pray, and <hi>turne;</hi> but here is a checke for the one, and

            <p>Bee thou as good as King <hi>David, a man after Gods owne heart;</hi> yet K. <hi>David</hi> may fall into an <hi>adulterie,</hi> and a <hi>ſelfe confidence:</hi> and therefore not hee ſo good, but hee muſt <hi>turne.</hi> And indeed, how often did hee <hi>turne?</hi> Sometimes himſelfe to God, and ſometimes God to him, God to him by prayer, <hi>Turne not away thy face from thine annointed.</hi> And ſometimes himſelfe to God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Turne me, O God, and I ſhal be turned.</hi> And this is to teach good men, that when God is turned from them, or they from God, then that they by prayer ſhould turne God to them; and they by repentance turne themſelves to God, by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from their wicked wayes.</p>
            <p>Nor none ſo bad neither, but hee may turne; not the Publican: and therefore Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,

               <hi>Iſrael</hi> was guilty of other ſinnes; yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not get the victory, till <hi>Achans</hi> ſinne was done away.

Other ſinnes there were, but the plague would not be ſtaied, till King <hi>David</hi> turned from his wicked way of ſelfe-confidence. Many other ſinnes there are now, for which this plague is amongſt us, but there are ſome wayes we walke in, ſome continued ſinnes, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly or outwardly, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes outwardly, Hypocriſies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; Adulteries outwardly, Concupiſcences inwardly; Pride

And this wee muſt eſpecially doe; eſpecially turne inwardly: for if we doe turne inwardly, we do turne outwardly. Whereas many men turne outwardly, that doe not turne inwardly. We may bee civill, yet hypocrites: we may bee chaſte for the outward man, and yet adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous within: wee may bee humble outwardly, as <hi>Achab</hi> was, and yet ambitious in our hearts, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> was: wee may bee prodigall in the outward acts of charity, and yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous within in our deſires.</p>

            <p>And what ſay the Schooles of this?

The turning with our heart, is the heart of turning; the repentance of the ſoule, is the ſoule of repentance.</hi> And becauſe this is all in all, I ſhall ſhew you in a word for all, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you doe turne from your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wayes with your hearts. There are two ſpeciall rules to know it by: The firſt is <hi>Si in,</hi> the ſecond is <hi>Si poſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Si in:</hi> if <hi>in</hi> the act of our tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3630:57"/>we reſolve never to have any more to do with ſinne: if we throw our ſins away,<note place="margin">Hoſea 14.8.</note> as repenting <hi>Ephraim</hi> did: <hi>What have I any more to doe with Idols? Fie, Get you hence.</hi> Give me leave to aske ſome of you, Why doe you Vſurers call in for your money now? Becauſe you will have no more to doe with uſurie? or for feare you ſhould looſe your money in this ſickneſſe, and that when the ſickneſſe is paſt, you may have money to put out to uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? It is a turning this; But ſuch a turning, that for all this, the plague may turn you into the earth, and theſe <hi>Reſervations</hi> into Hell. I could aske the Drunkard the ſame queſtion, Why does hee lay aſide his pots now? Becauſe he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee drunke againe? or becauſe he feares by ſuch quaffing, hee may inflame his blood, and get the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? and that at the fall, he may
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3630:58"/>have his health, and fall to his Healths againe? It is a turning, this but, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If you would have the plague turne from your heart, turne you from your ſinnes, with all your hearts, with the reſolutions and proteſtations of your hearts, That you will never have any more to doe with ſinne. That is the firſt note.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The ſecond,<note place="margin">Tertul.</note> 
               <hi>Si poſt ſequatur emendatio vitae, If after this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there followes amendment, and a better life. Poenitentia ſine emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datione vitae vana, quia caret fructu cui Deus eam ſervit. In vain is that repentance, which is not followed with a better life; becauſe it beares not that fruit, for which God planted it:</hi> that is, the fruits of <hi>Righteouſneſſe.</hi> If thou finde thy ſelfe after the plague, as bad as thou waſt before the plague; in the plague thou haſt
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3630:58"/>repented, but ſo, that for all that, God will follow thee with another plague, or ſend thee into hell for it. The plague never kills, till it hath poyſoned the heart: nor is the plague ever killed, til the heart hath poyſoned it with <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From Plague and Hell good Lord deliver us all.</hi> And that wee may all be delivered thence, <hi>God give us grace to turne from all our wicked wayes with all our hearts; and aſſure us thereof in our holy reſolutions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and in our holy converſations futurely; that preſently wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine health, and futurely ſalvation, through</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>That you may bee ſure this is the meaning, you may looke upon the prayer, to which this Text is the anſwer. The prayer was this, <hi>If there be a peſtilence,</hi>

            <p>Firſt, there is a time we may find,<note place="margin">1<hi rend="sup">a,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">ae,</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">ae,</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ae.</hi> Seeke <hi>God,</hi> when.</note> if we ſeeke; ſecondly, there is a time we ſhall finde, if wee ſeeke; and thirdly, there is a time, though we ſeeke, yet we ſhall not finde.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we may chance to finde him, if wee ſeeke him upon our Death-beds, and never till then.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3630:72"/>But it is a chance, this, and a meere chance, if wee doe; ſome one, or two there are amongſt 10000. that have ſo done: but it is not ſafe to follow this example; hee were but a mad man, that having a long journey to goe, would leave his money behinde him, becauſe hee hath heard of one or two that have found a purſe of money in their journey: And little leſſe than mad is hee, that will deferre ſeeking of God till his Death-bed, hoping to finde him then, becauſe one Thiefe upon the Croſſe did ſo: there is no certainty this way; no wiſedome to truſt to this.</p>
            <p>To <hi>ſeeke,</hi> I told you before, is an act of diligence, we muſt ſtirre our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and turne our ſelves this way, and that way, and every way; and enquire of every one we meete, if we intend to finde what we ſeeke: But then, upon our Death-beds,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3630:72"/>alas, God knows, wee cannot ſtirre our ſelves, much leſſe turne our ſelves; nor hardly enquire what we have to doe for paine. All that we can doe then, is to lye ſtill in our beds, and let the Miniſter ſpeake a few words in our eares; and if he wil be ſo kinde, as to adminiſter a little comfortable Divinity to our ſoules, and ſo ſend them away, God knows whither: I ſpeake not this, that any old man ſhould deſpaire, no, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire not, though you never ſought God till your Death-beds; for one there was, and a Thiefe hee was, that never ſought till then, and then did finde: But he was but one, and therefore doe you young men take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Away, I know you not;</hi> that wee may not receive the like anſwer, I pray God give us grace to ſeeke ſooner. There is more hope to prevent the fire, when it is upon our Neighbours houſe, than to quench the fire, when it is upon our owne houſe: and it is more poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to finde God, if wee ſeeke his face, when the plague is amongſt us, then if wee deferre it, till the plague be upon us: <hi>If I ſend a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence amongſt my people,</hi> is the Text, <hi>not upon them:</hi> while it is <hi>In aelios, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others,</hi> let us ſeeke, and not put off till it be <hi>In nos, Vpon us;</hi> and ſo happily we may finde him ſo, as to preſerve us ſtill from the plague, and to heale them of the plague. And God grant wee may ſo ſeeke, and ſeeke ſo ſucceſſefully through <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a time, that though we ſeeke, yet we ſhall not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3630:73"/>finde; ſo ſayes the Prophet:<note place="margin">Hoſe. 5.6.</note>

               <note place="margin">Iſa. 55.6.</note> And this ſhews plainely, that a time there is, though men ſeeke him, yet they ſhall not finde him; And ſo St. <hi>Bernard</hi> comments the words, <hi>Erit procul dubio cum inveniri non poterit,</hi>

            <p>Was this Sermon preached onely to him? ſurely it was penned alſo for me: <hi>For whatſoever is written, is written for our inſtruction.</hi> And the Inſtruction of this is, to tell me, whither I ſhould goe when I am recovered of a Sickneſſe, from this mans Example, <hi>To the Temple;</hi> and what I ſhould doe, from <hi>Chriſts</hi>

            <p>In hope I ſhall have grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thy Deſire, I beginne; and in my beginning I deſire thee to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my Duty, it is my Duty, for <hi>Moſes</hi> did it by way of Duty: Hee ſung praiſes to the Higheſt, after that <hi>God</hi> had delivered <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and ſo did <hi>Deborah,</hi> ſhe gave thankes to the Almighty, after that God had given her victory over <hi>Siſerah.</hi> And

Thus did <hi>Chriſts</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and woe bee to me, if I doe not ſo too: If I am unthankfull for what I have, I am unworthy of what I would have; whereas a thankfull acknowledgment of what I have received already, is a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull invitation to receive more hereafter.</p>
            <p>To thee therefore ô God I give thanks for what I have received; I have received Health, the Health of my Body; I bleſſe thee for it with my Soule. Oh that thou wouldſt with that, give me this, the health of my Soule, with the health of my Body, and then would I

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3630:113"/>deſerve your kind entertainment, &amp; courteous embraces; ſo eaſie, that the thinneſt capacity may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, that the dulleſt underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may conceive it; for who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not Mans duty? <hi>O give thanks unto the God of Heaven:</hi> and Gods pitty, <hi>For his mercy endures for ever;</hi> ſo ſhort that it conſiſts but of ſix words, three in the former, <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Deum Coelorum;</hi> and three in the latter part of the Verſe, <hi>In ſaeculae miſericordia ejus:</hi> And which of your memories is ſo brittle, that it cannot remember ſixe? I never read but of one man that could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member five; not one of you is that one man: you can remember ſixe. And to invite your Memory, it is ſweete to your Affections too, as ſweet as heart can deſire. What doth the guilty man deſire, but <hi>Mercy? Mercy</hi> to remit his ſinnes. What doth the offending man deſire, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3630:113"/>
               <hi>Mercy? Mercy</hi> to dimit his faults. What doth the leprous man deſire, but <hi>Mercy? Mercy</hi> to cleanſe him of his leproſie. What doth the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved man deſire, but <hi>Mercy? Mercy</hi> to redeeme him from his bondage, and to ſet him at liberty. What doth the ſick man deſire, but <hi>Mercy? Mercy</hi> to cure him of his ſickneſſe. This, this is the deſire of all your hearts; this reliſhes ſweetly in your affections, that God in mercy would remove the Plague from amongſt us: Why ſee, to give the Text a welcome, this is in the Text too; it is the very ground of the Text, <hi>For his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be not eaſie, ſhort, and ſweet enough, why then divide the Text, and the parts of it will bee more facile for the Vnderſtanding, more portable for the Memory, and more toothſomme to the Affections: ſo portable for the Memory, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3630:114"/>they are but two; and thoſe two ſo facile for the underſtanding, that they are the plaineſt of all other.</p>
            <p>Firſt, an Exhortation to the Dutie of Thankfulneſſe, <hi>O give thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the God of Heaven:</hi> And ſecondly, a Perſwaſion to doe that Duty; for if any one ſhould aske why? why <hi>give thanks unto the God of Heaven?</hi> why? why becauſe <hi>his mercy endures for ever,</hi> that is the maine part, and what ſo delightſome to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of miſerable man, as the <hi>Mercy</hi> of a pittifull God?</p>
            <p>Or if you will enlarge it, to make it more delightſome to the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and more plaine to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though a little more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſome to the memory: Then you have in the Exhortation theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the paſſion of the delivery, <hi>Oh;</hi> not ſimply, doe it, but <hi>Oh,</hi> doe it.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:3630:114"/>
            <p>Secondly, the Ingemination of the Duty, <hi>Oh, give thanks,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and <hi>Oh, give thanks</hi> in the ending of the <hi>Pſalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Excellency of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not to the King of men, not to the gods of the Heathen, no; but <hi>to the God of Heaven,</hi> or <hi>the Heavenly God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then againe, in the perſwaſion you have theſe foure particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What it is <hi>to endure for ever:</hi> if you doe not aske that queſtion, you will hardly underſtand what it meanes, how <hi>his mercy endures for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, How this is true, <hi>His mercy endures for ever:</hi> For if you doe not know that to be true, or how that is true, the Affections will by and by, grow nauſeous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, why <hi>David</hi> chuſes rather this than Judgement. If you read the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and read therein, <hi>Hee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3630:115"/>overthrew</hi> Pharaoh <hi>in the Red Sea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 15.</note> 
               <hi>he ſlew famous Kings:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 18. </note> Or if you look upon the times, and therein ſee the Plague; why it may as well ſtand, one would thinke, <hi>His judgement en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then fourthly and laſtly, why the Prophet repeats this ſo often, <hi>His mercy endures for ever,</hi> Twenty ſixe times in this one <hi>Pſalme?</hi> and when you underſtand this, it will make the Duty goe downe a great deale better; that is my firſt part, and I begin with it: I call'd it an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ſo it is; for herein <hi>David</hi> the King exhorts us that are ſubjects, <hi>to give thankes to the God of Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Part 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A duty this is, and ſuch a duty, that it needes not my Rethoricke to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten it upon you: The Heaven and the Earth, the Sea and the Rivers, the Husbandman and his ground, the Shepheard and his Sheepe, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier and his Aſſe doe all perſwade it:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3630:115"/>Heaven drops downe ſhowres, and the Earth in Thankfulneſſe ſprouts up Flowers; the Sea fills the Rivers, the Rivers in Thankfulneſſe empty themſelves into the Sea againe; the Husbandman throwes his Corne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground, the ground in Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe returnes him ten for one; the Shepheard feeds his ſheepe, the Sheepe in Thankfulneſſe cloath the Shepheard; the Carrier baites his Aſſe, the Aſſe in Thankfulneſſe carries him. I pray God we prove not worſe than the Aſſe in unthan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to God, for delivering us from the plague and peſtilence.</p>
            <p>Such a Duty it is, that no duty hath ſtronger precepts for it; no duty hath better patterns of it, no Duty hath fairer promiſes to it. The Old and the New Teſtament doe both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Apoſtles did all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, and the God of all, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Pſ. 50.14. 1 Theſ. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Offer unto God Thankſgiving</hi> ſaies the Prophet; <hi>In all things give thankes</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and as if Nature did concurre with Scripture, <hi>Ingratum ſi dixeris, &amp; omnia dixeris</hi> ſaies the meere naturall; you cannot ſay worſe of any man, than to ſay, <hi>He is unthankfull:</hi> And well ſayd that Royall King of bleſſed Memory, who knew the depths of Nature, and Texts of Scripture as well as any King before him, <hi>Ingratus de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritis, indignus de futuris: He that is unthankfull for what he hath, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to have what he wants:</hi> And if wee are unthankefull for our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from this laſt Plague, we ſhall be unworthy to bee preſerved from the next Plague.</p>
            <p>Chriſt therefore charged the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that was cleanſed, to offer for his Cleanſing, as <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded; and what was that, but as at leaſt <hi>a

            <p>And now I doubt not, but you are all ready to ſay, <hi>Give thankes,</hi> who does not? wee all <hi>give thankes unto the God of Heaven:</hi> Nor doe I doubt but you all ſay ſo; my doubt is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you doe ſo: For <hi>Thankſgiving,</hi> I muſt tell you, is no complement, no verball thing, but a Reality; it hath three words to expreſſe it by, and muſt be done in all three, elſe it is not done at all.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>Gratias habere, To have thanks;</hi> and it is called <hi>Recognition,</hi> his place of reſidence is the Heart: when we thinke how gracious God hath beene to us this Viſitation, the Plague tooke ſome away before me, ſome behinde me; ſome on my right hand, ſome on my left, yet I am left; God hath annointed the poſts of my doore with the blood of the Lambe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3630:118"/>that the deſtroying Angell might paſſe over mee, and my heart muſes what to render to the Lord for this his goodneſſe? when wee doe ſo, why then <hi>Gratiaes habemus,</hi> we have thanks in our hearts for God, or wee have Thankfull hearts to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is <hi>Gratias referre;</hi> To returne thankes, and it is called commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, his Elocutour is the Tongue, when wee declare the wonders God hath done for us, the Plague knockt at my Neighbours doore, but paſſed mine, I was as fit an object for that deſtruction as any man, but God in mercy ſpared me, Bleſſed bee his name, and my Tongue ſaies, what ſhall I render unto the Lord for all the Benefits hee hath done unto mee, when wee ſay ſo, why then wee doe <hi>Gratias referre,</hi> give Thankes with our Tongues to God.</p>
            <p>The 3. is <hi>Gratias agere</hi> to doe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3630:118"/>Thankes; and it is called <hi>Retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> the Actor of it is the Hand, or Life; when the hand gives the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Thankes, and the Life does the offerings of Thanks in ſanctity to God, and is acceptable to him: in equity to man, and is unreprove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with them: in Charity to the poore, and is profitable to them: When we doe ſo, why then, <hi>Gratias agimus, We doe, and wee doe give thankes to the God of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So wee doe to man, if a man doth us but ordinary courteſies at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary pinch; why then wee doe firſt ſtudie to magnifie him in our hearts: we were in Priſon, hee hath payed our Debts, and ſet us at liberty: we were in Captivity, he hath redeemed us, and made us free, we were in danger, hee hath reſcued and made us ſafe, ô what a friend was this, think wee! how good hath hee bin unto us! and ſo <hi>Gratias habemus.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:3630:119"/>And then ſecondly we ſpeake of him to others, how good he hath beene to us; this, and this he hath done for me, God reward him for it, and ſo <hi>Gratias referimus.</hi> And thirdly wee caſt with our ſelves how to requite him; hee ſhall no ſooner command, but we obey, and ſo <hi>Gratias agimus;</hi> and ſhall wee not doe ſo to God? From him we have whatſoever wee have, Redemption from the hands of all that hate us, Preſervation from the Plague and peſtilence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt <hi>give thanks to the God of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely the very Heathens inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no leſſe in their <hi>Charites,</hi> they were three: The firſt was <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This we ſhould doe indeed, but indeed, this we doe nor; wee rather ſeeke to make men worſe and worſe, than better and better: We, alas, if we ſee a Drunkard, we call him to the Taverne; if an Adulterer, to the Stews; if a Glutton, to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; if a coverous man, to the houſe of providence, the Vſurer or the Broker: So forward are wee for ſin, that wee infect one another; and therefore no wonder that the Plague hath beene amongſt us; ſo backward are we for Grace, that a wonder i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It is my third Conſideration, and the ſecond particular of my firſt part, the Ingemination.</p>
            <p>But what needs this? what needed the Prophet to double an Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch conſequence? had not one beene enough? can wee forget this, <hi>To give thanks?</hi> Can wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this yeere 1636, that ſo many have beene ſwept away, ſwept away by the Plague, and wee left behinde? Can wee remember this, and not <hi>give thankes to the God of Heaven,</hi> though it were but once ſpoke of? Such a Schoole maſter as <hi>David</hi> would not; but wee, we,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3630:122"/>ſuch Schollers as wee are, have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories ſo labile, and ſo fragile, ſo brittle, and ſo ſhort, that, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, we need Repetition upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition; Exhortation upon Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; elſe we ſhall, and will forget <hi>to give thankes unto the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> So brittle are our memories this way, God bleſſe us, that wee need an <hi>In emination;</hi> but ſo faſt, and ſtrong another way, God bee mercifull unto us, that we need not ſo much as a ſingle remembrance: An injury we can remember a long time, an ill turne, nay, an ill word from our Neighbour, from our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, <hi>Manet alta mente repoſtum,</hi> we cannot eaſily remove it; ſuch a thing as this is ſoundly ſettled: but bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and good turnes, how quickly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, doe we forget them?</p>
            <p>So forgetfull were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> this way,<note place="margin">Hoſea 4.6 Pſ. 106.21</note> that they forgat the Law of God; nay, they forgat God that

His Day, notwithſtanding his <hi>Memento,</hi> we forget; even that Day which hee commanded to be ſanctified, whether the Seventh, or the Eigth day, or one in the ſeven, we prophane them all. That day wherein he made us whole from the horrour of Hell, by the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour; and that day wherein he made us whole from the terrour of the Plague, by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that deſtroying Angell to hold his hand: And therefore bleſſed be his Name for this <hi>Ingemination</hi> of his ſervant <hi>David, Oh give thanks, ô give thanks unto the God of Heaven.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Deum Coelerum, The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> This is the marke whither wee muſt ayme in ſhooting our <hi>Thankes;</hi> and my fourth Conſideration, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3630:123"/>third particular of my firſt part: And herein you have three Directions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, a Direction for the Object, <hi>to God.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a Direction for the matter, <hi>for heavenly bleſsings:</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thirdly, a Direction for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>with heavenly praiſes.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the Object, is directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Papiſts; the Direction for the matter, is point-blanke againſt Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſts, the Direction for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is abſolutely againſt Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the Papiſt, hee prayes to Saints, but never gives thankes to Saints; and yet Thankſgiving is a chiefe part of Prayer, the firſt part, the laſt part, indeed, all in all. He that prayes, prayes for what hee wants, and ſo looks upon his owne neceſſity: but he that <hi>gives thankes, gives thankes</hi> for what he hath, and ſo lookes upon Gods bounty. Now by the rule of Order, he, to whom
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3630:123"/>one part of Prayer is due, to him is every part of Prayer due: But the Papiſts by their owne Act deny Thankſgiving to bee due to Saints. For where is the Papiſt that did ever give thankes to Saint <hi>Roch,</hi> or Saint <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> for ſtaying of the Plague? yet they are their Plague-ſaviours: where is the <hi>Pſalter</hi> that hath any <hi>Benedicamus</hi> to any, but to the <hi>God of Heaven?</hi> But this is a matter of Diſpute, and this is not a place for Diſpute, I therefore ſay no more of it, but this <hi>to the God of Heaven:</hi> God grant, that in the time of the Plague, or any other calamity, we may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver betake our ſelves to any other refuge than <hi>Vmbra Altiſſimi, The right hand of God;</hi> nor give our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when we are delivered from the Plague, than <hi>Nomen Altiſſimi, The mercy of God,</hi> as wee doe this Day, <hi>give thanks to the God of Heaven,</hi> who hath delivered us from the plague.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:3630:124"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Mammoniſt, the worldling, the covetous man, the Vſurer, and his pew-fellow, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; he prayes for earthly bleſſings, and he gives thanks for earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; earthly bleſſings muſt not be forgotten; no: therefore the Church hath appointed Perambulations, <hi>to give thankes to the God of Heaven</hi> for his bleſſings upon the Earth: but for all that, Heavenly bleſſings muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially be remembred; for ſparing us ſo long, and giving us ſo large a time of Repentance; for his Word and Sacraments, for a religious King, for a holy Clergy, for a conſcionable Magiſtracy, and ſuch other meanes of Grace; for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our ſinnes, and ſuch heavenly bleſſings, <hi>Ob give thankes unto the God of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thankfulneſſe, I confeſſe, is a common duty for all bleſſings, and a neceſſary duty for all bleſſings; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3630:124"/>yet ſometimes the very doing of this duty, is worſe than the neglect of it: When the Taylor lookes upon his cloaths, which hee ſtole from the Gentleman he made the laſt ſuit for; when the Vſurer lookes upon his Thouſands which he hath gotten by Eight in the Hundred: when the Shop-keeper beholds his bagges, which hee hath filled by ſelling his Wares at unconſcionable rates: when the Executor lookes upon his large revenues which hee hath cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:3630:125"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Hypocrite, hee gives thankes to the God of Heaven, but it is with lips, his heart is farre off; or if his heart and tongue bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times friends, yet his life is falſe, and ſpurious, becauſe he is envious and malicious; ſometimes barking at the <hi>Churches Diſcipline,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times detracting from his neighbors worth, and ſo hee ſeemes to man to give thankes, he cares not to abuſe, and mocke, and diſſemble with the God of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But I might have ſpared theſe three laſt Notes: for you are not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Papiſts; you give <hi>thankes</hi> to God onely: you are not covetous Mammoniſts; your bleſſings that you give <hi>thanks</hi> for came from Heaven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A likely thing that God ſhould be more cruel then man! Did ever any of you, nay, did ever any man get, or beget a child purpoſely to breake his necke when hee was borne? Why? if there could be a man ſo cruell to his Childe that came from his owne loynes, why yet God would be more cruell, if he ſhould make any man on purpoſe for to damne him: for Damnation is a thing farre, and infinite worſe than Death; for by Death, a Child is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the miſeries of this World; but by Damnation, a man is taken from the pleaſures of this world, and hurled into unſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments.</p>
            <p>Good <hi>God,</hi> that any man ſhould
